1- One of the most important things kotlin is that, once you declare a variable
Kotlin can infer the variable's type from the value it's given.
    Ex:
        var x: Int = 5
        var x = 5 -> You don't need to type the :Int after de variable name.

    To create a variable, the compiler needs to know its name, type and
    whether it can be reused.
    The value is transformed into an object.
    In the example above, the compiler knows that the value 5 is a Int number.
    So, the code creates a new Int object with a value of 5.
    The variable x holds a reference to the object.

2- val VS var
    If you declare the variable using 'val', the reference to the object
    can not be replaced. So its value remains the same forever.
    But if you declare it using 'var' you can assign another value to the
    variable.

3- Strings templates is used to create complex Strings with very little code.
