1- In Kotlin, when we declare a new Function(), if the function doesn't returns anything,
you can explicit it with the ": Unit" type. This works like "Void" in C.
    ex:
        fun add(n1: Int, n2: Int): Unit
        {
            println("add: ${n1 + n2}")
        }
        OR
        fun greet(): Unit
        {
            println("Hello world!")
        }

    OBS-> It is totally optional. So, it means that you don't need to declare it.

2- In Kotlin, as in C, when you pass a argument as parameter to a function(), you pass a reference
to that object. So, you can change the value in the memory.
