1- Kotlin Class: "Classes are templates that allow you to create your own types of objects, and
define their properties and functions/methods".
ex:
    when you type:
        var x = 42
        "You are telling the compiler that you are creating a new object of Int type. And the x
        variable are saving a reference to that Int object."
        "So, as you just created a new Int object, you can use all the Int class methods. toString()
        and others..."

2- As a normal variable, when you create a Class and one of its attributes is "val", you cannot
change the value once you already define it.
ex:
    Class
