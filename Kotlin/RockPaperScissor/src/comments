1- In Kotlin, when we declare a new Function(), if the function doesn't returns anything,
you can explicit it with the ": Unit" type. This works like "Void" in C.
    ex:
        fun add(n1: Int, n2: Int): Unit
        {
            println("add: ${n1 + n2}")
        }
        OR
        fun greet(): Unit
        {
            println("Hello world!")
        }

    OBS-> It is totally optional. So, it means that you don't need to declare it.

2- In Kotlin, as in C, when you pass a argument as parameter to a function(), you pass a reference
to that object. So, you can change the value in the memory.

3- In Kotlin, you can do a loop decrementing using 'downTo' instead os '..' or 'until'.
ex:
    for (x in 15 downTo 1)
    {
        println(x);
    }

4- You can also skip numbers in the range. Using the same operators 'downTo, until ...'
ex:
    for (x in 1..100 step 2)
    {
        println(x) //this is going to print only the odd numbers in the range of 1 to 100
    }

5- ReadLine() function is similar to the ReadLine() in C: It reads a line of input from the STD_IN.
In a success case, returns a String with the user input. Returns null if fails.

6- The comparison operators "|| && == != !" is equal in C.
